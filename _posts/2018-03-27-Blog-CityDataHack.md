<h1>City Data Hack at Urban Innovation Centre, London</h1>

<img src="/img/blog/citydatahack/team.jpeg" class="img-rounded img-fluid" />

<p>The hack focused on using data to solve urban challenges like social isolation, unemployment and transport difficulties. There were eleven teams with 60 hackers from a range of backgrounds include data, UX, software engineering and service design. Many had a special interest in urban planning and there were quite a few students present.</p>

<p>Future Cities Catapult and Space Syntax were the hosts of this hackathon by Tombolo, held at the Urban Innovation Centre in London from 16–18 March 2018.</p>

<p>Tombolo is a Future Cities Catapult and Space Syntax R&D project funded by Innovate UK. They have created the Digital Connector which was used by teams during the hack. They explored how city authorities could improve their use of data in solving urban challenges.</p>

<p>Three challenges were provided by the challenge partners:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Skills and Education – Greater London Authority</li>
 <li>Social Isolation – London Borough of Barking and Dagenham</li>
 <li>Active Travel Plans – Transport for London</li>
</ul>

<p>Multi-disciplinary teams had 48 hours to hack the data, try out some new tools, including the Digital Connector and a data visualisation platform, analyse data to uncover new and relevant insights, then propose how each city authority could redesign their services to tackle their local challenge.</p>

<p>The hackathon included mentorship from experienced data scientists, digital designers, service designers and open source experts who work in the urban planning space.</p>

<p>Here are the teams who participated in the City Data Hack:</p>

    This team also tackled social isolation and being excluded from the community. Their solution was targeted at elderly people who are feeling lonely. They created a bot as a form of AI that can propose an event based on your location that helps neighbours communicate with each other. They called it ‘spirit of the place’ since it personifies a building shared by neighbours such as a block of flats or a neighbourhood.

    This team also did social isolation and being excluded from the community, which affects 15% of the population – both young and old people in particular. Their app focused on our ‘internal weather’, with the weather as a metaphor for how we’re feeling. They wanted it to be both personal and local, and their strapline is: “Bringing sunshine to Barking and Dagenham”.

    This team was solving the problem of young people and unemployment, and how we can get young people to explore different career options to the traditional university pathway. Their platform is called SEEB and it matched skills and aspirations with vocational training, courses and jobs.

    Another team that went for social isolation and being excluded from the community. They created a web-based application to help people help themselves by focusing on a sense of accomplishment. It’s aimed at being a source of encouragement for people who are feeling lonely.

    This team focused on active transit, so they came up with a portal to help TFL (Transport for London) to communicate with its property developers, allowing them to set up targets that would help to monitor project progress.

    This team addressed employment and skills challenges, disrupting the standard technology which is typically quizzes and surveys. Their web-based app uses data to help people visualize their interests and career priorities on a graph. It then links on to further vocational and training options.

    Bee Hive developed a travel planning tool that helps city developers gain access to urban data earlier in the development process. This means they can make urban planning more accessible for residents and provide desperately needed amenities. This will improve infrastructure and reduce the cost of travel.
